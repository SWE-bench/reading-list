# Awesome AI4SE
Research papers and publications related to the development and evaluation of AI systems for software engineering

Criteria for inclusion:
1. The work is related to AI systems for software engineering (AI4SE). For this list, "AI" tends to mean language models (LMs).
2. The work is released as a research paper, preprint, or academic publication.
3. The work includes open source code and artifacts.

> [!NOTE]  
> The focus of this list more on research and academic contributions. Products and open source tools evaluated on SWE-bench are out of scope, but are welcome as submissions to the [SWE-bench leaderboard](https://github.com/swe-bench/experiments).
